1. All account Histories can be reviewed under User > Histories.
2. Locate deleted but not permemently deleted histories and purge them.

Notes:
- Download any datasets or entire histories you want to keep first. The history will need to be in an active state. Histories that are deleted can be undeleted, but once a history is purged (aka permenently deleted) it cannot be recovered, even by an administrator.
- Histories must be unshared before they can be deleted or purged. Unshare first as needed.
- Histories in a deleted state are still part of your quota usage.
- Histories must be purged (permanently deleted) to not count toward quota.
